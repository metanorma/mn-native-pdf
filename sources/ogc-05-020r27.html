Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>
        <p id="_4b0fad66-d23f-4c5f-8b34-137fbe6661a8">A document, established by consensus and approved by the OGC Membership, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</p>
        <p id="_6725574a-9408-47a3-9e4a-aadf6807d6df">To guide an open standards development and approval process, a member approved Policies and Procedures is required.</p>
        <p id="_547da3ee-7dc7-457a-b486-f1236aff1d46">This document describes the OGC Technical Committee (TC) policies and procedures (P&amp;P). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC. The Technical Committee Chair (TCC&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;see <a href="#role-of-the-technical-committee-chair">Clause 2.2</a>) facilitates the TC process.</p>

        <p id="_6ae40de4-f534-4f81-9e3c-cccc3fc2b89b">A broad definition of a consortium is: a combination or group of organizations formed to undertake a common objective that is beyond the resources or capabilities of any single organization. The OGC was formed to provide a collaborative, consensus forum for the discussion and resolution of interoperability issues in the geospatial domain. The work of the consortium is based on volunteerism.</p>
        <p id="_ae865a17-3395-4e2e-a14b-78a915e6d484">More specifically in the standards area, a consortium has the following characteristics:</p>

<li>
<p id="_594322db-9a86-4809-bad9-1532965487e9">Has as its primary goal(s) the creation and/or promotion of international standards (most commonly in the IT area);</p>

<li>
<p id="_b537f5a7-c980-4ff6-9564-225ecab8e962">Creates what would be acknowledged to be &#x201C;open&#x201D; standards made available on Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing/">RAND</a>) terms; and</p>

In the terminology defined in ISO 19135-1:2015, OGC-NA is the Control Body for the register of OGC Names: this document describes the framework of documents, registers and other resources required for OGC-NA to execute that role.

An ad-hoc meeting is to 1.) judge interest in forming the new sub-group and 2.) define the scope of work for the proposed new sub-group.</p>

Also, like any other sub-group meeting of the TC, they shall announce the meeting to the broader TC and communicate an agenda.

<p id="_736ab8ec-d774-4ab3-bf45-2c45f6c6f70b">SWGs operate under the same general voting rules as other sub-groups of the TC, namely Votes in an SWG follow the same guidelines as for the Technical Committee except that quorum is 1/2 of active voting members (see <a href="#caveat-on-voting-rights-if-you-do-not-participate-on-a-regular-basis">Clause 6.7.9</a>) unless the SWG votes to have a larger fraction be quorum. See <a href="#subgroups-of-the-tc-electronic-voting">Clause 5.5</a> for electronic votes for sub-groups of the TC. The one notable exception related to SWG votes is that only member representatives who have opted into the SWG may vote.</p>

If you do not participate in the teleconferences and email discussions and vote on items and issues, you will lose your voting privileges and have your SWG member status changed from &#x201C;Voting&#x201D; to &#x201C;Group Member&#x201D;. The SWG Chair has the authority and the ability to make these changes based on the following policy.</p>
<p id="_eeb6e283-f1e0-4035-8987-c6393c713737">Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Insuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. If the voting member wishes not to assign their proxy, they can ask to change their status to &#x201C;Observer&#x201D; and still actively participate in the SWG.</p></div>

<p id="_a058a0ae-e018-4509-b3b9-61c5a0d14338">Many technical issues discussed in a SWG will require collaboration and communication with other SWGs. As long as the voting members agree to such cross SWG communication, then an open dialogue between two or more SWGs can occur on any specific technical issue.</p>

Presentations in TC Meetings which the SWG permits to be viewed by general OGC membership should be stored in the TC Meeting folder for that SWG or in the SWG Portal project files with a symbolic link to the TC Meeting folder. All draft documents for SWG discussion should be in the SWG files until that point those documents are to be discussed in the TC. SWG documents for TC discussion or voting are to be uploaded to Pending Documents.</p>

A SWG may also vote to allow non-OGC members to participate in the development of the standard in the collaboration environment. Note that such a vote does not grant access to non-members to the OGC Portal nor does it give those non-members voting rights for SWG approval of any work.</p>
<p id="_aafbab2d-a046-4d7e-a983-a4867cf87130">The collaboration environment will be under ultimate control of the OGC. For example, OGC maintains organizational structures in GitHub and SVN under which SWGs can create a project for their use. Non-OGC private repositories or projects may not be used for development of SWG deliverables.</p>
<p id="_2f8d5ce8-c795-4b36-92ba-6f13d94c904e">The collaboration environment must clearly display a message on its home page (e.g., the README file in GitHub) that states the contributions to the work in the collaboration environment belong to OGC, as shown below.</p>

Please remember that there is the official formal 30-day public comment period. However, a SWG is encouraged to release an in-progress document early in the process in order to solicit input from the community. If a SWG votes to release a document for early public comment, it must coordinate with OGC Communications to generate a press release and properly create the Request For Comments (RFC) on the OGC website.</p>

The new work can result in an update, extension, or profile of a standard.</p>
<p id="_5d6b5f50-cc51-4294-86fe-0d343ac59bf3">The proposed Task must be presented to the TC at a plenary. Otherwise, a PowerPoint or video presentation will be developed and posted to the Portal. This presentation should cover the key aspects of the Task, especially the scope of work, the timeline, and the technical discussion related how the work relates to the standard(s) developed by the SWG.</p>
<p id="_096cbd89-30f7-418b-b2f8-1dc7f2c7740d">Once the proposed Task has been presented to the TC, the TCC will initiate a 21 day TC and public review of the proposed Task.

<p id="_ffd405fb-2c60-4b2d-bc0f-c82216971f78">The proposed Task will be voted upon by TC Voting Members in a Closing Plenary (see <a href="#voting-at-tc-meetings">Clause 5.3</a>) or by a two-week email vote (see <a href="#tc-or-subgroups-of-the-tc-email-voting">Clause 5.6</a>).

</li>
<li>
<p id="_dc4c442f-ae3e-4a28-96ed-783b15d23186">Revisions to an adopted standard typically result in a change to the minor number. For example, the first revision to an adopted 1.0 standard would be 1.1.0. Minor revision releases should be 100% backwards compatible with the previous version.</p>

Further, for candidate standards developed external to the OGC and submitted into the OGC process, the PC may verify that the submitting organization has provided a duly executed submission of technology form. In addition, the TC recommends acceptance contingent on the PC&#x2019;s finding that the sponsoring organization(s) makes the technology available as per the OGC Intellectual Property Policies and Procedures.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn:21" epub:type="footnote" id="fnref:21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></div>

Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a standard in the Full standards track is defined as three or more documented implementations that meet the Nature of implementation criteria, below.

If any member feels that a standard needs to be changed, edited, or enhanced, they must submit a Change Request Proposal.</p>
<p id="_32bf07fb-19a4-479d-8314-ee11bfd8fbea">All voting in a SWG, whether for processing a candidate standard or for revisions to an existing standard will follow the rules as defined for <a href="#swg-voting">Clause 6.7.8</a>.</p>

Requests for revisions must be in the form of comments received during any public review period, such as for the OGC Consensus Standards process, or in the form of official CRPs. Ad-hoc emails and verbal requests at meetings will not be considered as official CRPs. However, the SWG may vote to discuss issues that have not been submitted as CRPs, and may vote to direct one or more of its members to create official CRPs to document an agreement reached as the result of those discussions.</p>
<p id="_f7f99f4c-d230-49e2-89f0-6ad65592c1bc">A major or minor version revision of a standard follows the process of the Full standards track with the initial revision approved as a Draft standard. A Corrigendum to a standard does not require new evidence of implementation and the Corrigendum is approved at the final stage of a standard.</p>

Please refer to <a href="#change-request-proposals-crp-to-an-ogc-document">Clause 8.9</a> for additional policies and procedures related to change request proposals. Once a list of change proposals has been compiled and the SWG has discussed the proposed changes, the SWG voting members shall vote on the disposition of each of the proposed changes. The SWG has the right to reject a recommended revision, comment, or correction but must provide a written justification for the rejection.</p>
<p id="_40835c73-eb35-4e21-b7a8-f5c83ff72b2f">Based on the outcome of the votes, SWG members then make the revisions and corrections to the target standard. Comments or CRPs received after the formation of a new SWG may or may not be considered for incorporation. This is at the discretion of the members of the SWG.</p></div>

A SWG can set and publicize a cut-off date beyond which it will not consider additional CRPs.  CRPs submitted after such a cut-off date must be considered as part of future revision activities.</p>
<p id="_2b5660fc-bb65-49fb-ba7a-eb38531b96d7">A cut-off date can be announced to the TC using the following rule: That a cut-off takes effect the end of the next meeting after it has been announced.
