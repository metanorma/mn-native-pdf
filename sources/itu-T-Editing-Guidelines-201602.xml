<p id="_a7fdd7a4-1547-4ad2-938f-c1d25ab391a1">This author's guide is intended to provide a common approach to the preparation of ITU-T texts that are intended for publication, e.g., draft Recommendations. It attempts to cover the kind of questions likely to arise in the preparation of an ITU-T Recommendation and provides, through application of its own rules, an illustration using the normal order of the elements of drafting a typical Recommendation. To avoid confusion which may result from this approach for a first-time reader, detailed explanations of the contents of each heading are given in <xref target="Description_of_introductory_material_to_be_provided_by_the_author"/> and <xref target="Description_of_core_material"/> below.</p>

<clause id="Mathematical_expressions_and_symbols_formulae_equations_etc" obligation="normative"><title>Mathematical expressions and symbols (formulae, equations, etc.)</title><clause id="Quantities_units_and_symbols" obligation="normative">
  <title>Quantities, units and symbols</title>
  <p id="_ba974848-adf6-4240-ac44-7d1ec88a6c0e">Physical quantities, units, symbol names and usage shall follow the International System of Units (SI), as defined by ISO. Letter symbols used to express quantities in an expression shall be listed with their explanations below the expression, or group of expressions, using them.</p>
</clause>
<clause id="Equations_and_formulae" obligation="normative"><title>Equations and formulae</title><p id="_a1f93642-f54c-4b53-b810-678b2fb9e393">Equations and formulae shall be in the mathematically correct form and shall occupy one or more lines with no text, unless text is an integral part of the expression. ITU formats all equations and formulae by means of MathType; to avoid transcription errors within ITU during publication, the use of this tool by the authors is encouraged.</p>
<p id="_f0919aa1-cf2e-4bf5-b751-e83ba16f9537">When necessary, equations should be given a number (placed between parentheses at the right margin of the page) that contains the main clause number plus a number in Arabic numerals in sequence from the beginning of this clause. For example, Equation 6-3 is the third mathematical expression in clause 6 of the Recommendation in which it is contained. Given the complicated nature of mathematical expressions, great care shall be exercised to ensure the clarity of manuscripts (e.g., for the vertical placement of subscripted or superscripted numbers or variables).</p></clause>
<clause id="Numbers_and_special_characters" obligation="normative"><title>Numbers and special characters</title><p id="_1a65cce7-4ff3-4abf-a257-65ea968426cc">In order to avoid ambiguity, it is recommended to use a single quote (') as a thousand's digit separator instead of spaces, commas or dots (e.g., "1'000'000").</p>
<p id="_7029d0b4-3159-4af8-8fb1-77c2f4e8e8ca">Arabic numerals and non-Latin characters (e.g., Greek, Cyrillic) should not be in italic typeface.</p></clause></clause>
<clause id="Figures_and_tables" obligation="normative"><title>Figures and tables</title><p id="_0f9ad969-7c97-4c77-9ce4-486eddbb97ef">Each figure and table shall be referred to explicitly within the text.</p>
<clause id="Figures" obligation="normative"><title>Figures</title><p id="_397b30d0-8398-4d2a-bfda-8b83d5f32103">Figures shall be numbered with Arabic numerals, beginning with 1 (within annexes or appendices, there will be a letter-plus-period or a Roman-numeral-plus-period prefix). This numbering shall normally be independent from the numbering of the clause and of any tables. For Recommendations which are very long or complex, however, the author may number figures sequentially with respect to the single digit clause number. For example, Figure 4-3 denotes the third figure in clause 4 of the Recommendation in which it is contained.</p>
<p id="_7a27bc36-84f3-4865-a98b-9c55399a03b8">The number and title shall be placed on the same line and centred, below the figure. The first letter of the title shall be capitalized; all other words shall not be capitalized unless they are special terms that are capitalized throughout the Recommendation in accordance with the conventions given.</p>
<p id="_0480616a-1ab2-4d1e-bf33-18afcdf33412">When a figure is in 2 parts (e.g., Figure 6, part a and part b), refer to these parts in the text as follows: Figure 6-a, Figure 6-b. They may be referred to collectively as Figure 6.</p>
<p id="_14d198d5-7d93-4f4f-918e-4114903b68fa">Figures and references to figures should generally be legible and understandable when using greyscale printing. It is helpful to remember that rich colours visible on computer monitors do not appear the same on paper and in the case of greyscale printing they often appear as black. To assure legibility, ITU-T uses 9pt Times New Roman font for text within figures.</p>
<p id="_a5a5366c-2762-47a0-b412-7ca4ff62676f">If there are too many objects on a figure, it is preferable to break the figure into several parts.</p>
<p id="_246e7a3f-3565-4186-98e9-0b34e85b0346">To facilitate the editing process of figures, authors are encouraged to submit additionally an editable source file for the figures in their original format (CorelDraw, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft PowerPoint, Micrografx Designer, etc.) when submitting the final text.</p>
<p id="_beee4538-7272-4f2d-a3bf-058c341f4eb2">It is recommended that the figure index that is shown in the lower right-hand corner of the figure be preserved if a figure previously published by ITU has formed the basis of the new or modified figure. This index allows TSB to locate the source, which can reduce the time to publication by allowing the reuse of the foundation drawing.</p>

<clause id="Tables" obligation="normative"><title>Tables</title><p id="_fb72a4b2-0967-4ae7-94eb-ef995313f51e">Tables shall be numbered with Arabic numerals, beginning with 1 (within annexes or appendices there will be a letter-plus-period or a Roman-numeral-plus-period prefix). This numbering shall normally be independent of the numbering of the clause and of any figures. For Recommendations which are very long and complex, the author may number sequentially with respect to the single digit clause number. For example, Table 4-3 denotes the third table in clause 4 of the Recommendation in which it is contained.</p>
<p id="_a483b0bc-0938-4a2f-a0f6-14cb0caedd26">The number and title shall be placed on the same line and centred, above the table. The first letter of the title shall be capitalized; all other words shall not be capitalized unless they are special terms that are capitalized throughout the Recommendation in accordance with the conventions given.</p>

<p id="_5dcea0f2-a042-4e6e-b146-bddad134344d">If the table is wider than a page width, then each row in the complete table shall be assigned an index number. Each sub-table shall contain the index number in the first column.</p></clause></clause>

Regardless of whether they occur singly or in one or more groups, all notes within the same numbered clause shall be numbered consecutively (i.e., NOTE 1 –, NOTE 2 –, NOTE 3 –, etc.).</p>

</fn> may be used to provide information regarding a particular item, word or concept. They shall be indicated by a superior positioned Arabic numeral at the appropriate location in the text and shall be numbered consecutively throughout the Recommendation. Both the indicator and the footnote itself shall be printed with a font one or two point sizes smaller than the main text.</p>
<p id="_bf9eeb6e-79e0-4a5f-8cfc-ab589c6dfb85">If the same footnote appears repeatedly on the same page of the text, the text of the footnote should be removed after the first time it is used. Furthermore, the same identifier for the footnote should be used for each occurrence of reference to that note on the page. Should the same footnote appear multiple times across multiple pages, the same rules within each page apply as above; however, the footnote should appear with a (possibly) different identifier for the first occurrence on each page.</p>

They shall be located for tables within the frame of the table, and for figures, between the figure and its title. Notes for each table and each figure shall be numbered independently. Such notes may contain normative specifications. Notes to a table or a figure can be indicated alternatively by a superscripted lower case letter (see <xref target="fig3"/>). Both the indicator and the note itself shall be printed in a font several point sizes smaller than the main text. To assure legibility, ITU-T uses 9pt Times New Roman font for text within figures and tables.</p>

  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p id="_84c019b8-123e-4234-92db-bb174cf5951f">A considerable amount of time is spent by study groups on terminology and definitions but the results can be duplicative and of inconsistent quality. Greater consistency is needed in the way definitions are drafted. In addition, consideration needs to be given to ensuring that definitions are drafted in a way that allows for automated compilation and processing of new definitions so that the ITU database of definitions can be more easily maintained. Annex 2 to WTSA Resolution 67 (Johannesburg, 2008) provides basic guidelines for the preparation of terms and definitions. This annex builds on that guidance to help study groups to adopt a consistent approach to terminology and definitions and also to address the requirements for automated updating of the terminology database.</p>

  <title>Terms and definitions</title>
  <p id="_f8e5a988-8829-48c4-92f9-032683c8f30d">A <em>term</em> is simply a word, or group of words that is used to express a specific concept. A <em>definition</em> is a clear, concise and accurate statement that expresses the precise meaning of a term or concept.</p>

While it is important that definitions accurately capture the subject concept or term, experience has shown that terminology discussions frequently consume significant technical meeting time. One way to reduce unnecessary discussion is to use already-defined terms.</p>
<p id="_0aa51175-6620-4d0e-a654-26677f32c949">New terms should not be developed where an acceptable definition already exists. Also, already-existing terms should not be redefined. Existing definitions should be consulted before any new definition is developed to check if the term/concept has already been defined. Only if no satisfactory definition exists should development of a new definition be considered. When defining a new term/concept, the name used for the term should not duplicate the name used for an already-defined term/concept.</p>
