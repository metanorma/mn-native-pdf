Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>
        <p id="_a0d89673-064a-43da-8a5b-1aa398ede0be">A document, established by consensus and approved by the OGC Membership, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</p>

        <p id="_d5945182-2699-4659-b981-f69fffdbbff9">This document describes the OGC Technical Committee (TC) policies and procedures (P&amp;P). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC. The Technical Committee Chair (TCC&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;see <a href="#role-of-the-technical-committee-chair-tcc">Clause 2.2</a>) facilitates the TC process.</p>

The OGC was formed to provide a collaborative, consensus forum for the discussion and resolution of interoperability issues in the geospatial domain.

Any TC member may send another representative of his or her organization as a substitute to a TC meeting (please note <a href="#proxy-for-voting">Clause 5.3.4</a>). Subgroups may only meet by being formally scheduled by the TCC or designee during the course of regularly scheduled TC meetings (subgroups cannot have alternative meetings that overlap temporally with the TC Meeting without approval of the TCC or PC).</p>

<p id="_d923d955-f8f5-44d3-84f2-fe7b43f2dc56">The three-week rule clause ensures that Voting TC members have adequate time to read, distribute and gather comments on documents before voting on the document at the following TC meeting.</p></div>

Also, like any other sub-group meeting of the TC, they shall announce the meeting to the broader TC and communicate an agenda.

<p id="_6094ca2e-d8e9-4045-b5b8-35e3d4927fea">Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Insuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. If the voting member wishes not to assign their proxy, they can ask to change their status to &#x201C;Observer&#x201D; and still actively participate in the SWG.</p></div>

<p id="_084528b6-db80-4efe-ac03-9d22c9c7a765">The TC e-vote is to recommend to the PC approval of the results of an adoption vote.

<p id="_3eebefd3-6386-4f5b-8d7d-1244f3694c29">Acceptance of the TC recommendation for adoption is always with the caveat that the PC may verify that the standard&#x2019;s sponsor organization(s) is/are in a position to develop (or have developed for the sponsor organization) or commercialize an implementation of the standard. Further, for candidate standards developed external to the OGC and submitted into the OGC process, the PC may verify that the submitting organization has provided a duly executed submission of technology form. In addition, the TC recommends acceptance contingent on the PC&#x2019;s finding that the sponsoring organization(s) makes the technology available as per the OGC Intellectual Property Policies and Procedures.</p>

For the Full Standards track, a SWG manages the RFC process.</p>

A CRP describes proposed changes or enhancements to an existing standard. A CRP may be submitted by one or more OGC member organizations. One or more CRs against an existing OGC standard is evidence that a revision process for that standard should be initiated.
